This notebook here depicts how the event(cardiac arrhythmia) classification block has been developed. 
Here, the data processed using the super-resolution network, ECG-SRCNN, has been used to test/verify the performance of the 
event classification network. Hence, this computes in a way a full scale performance metric of the whole end-to-end system.
